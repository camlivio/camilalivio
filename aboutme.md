### My Academic Interests
I first moved to the U.S. for a Fulbright fellowship back in 2013. I've always been interested in foreign languages and linguistics, which led me to a Ph.D. in Romance Languages. During my time as a graduate student I really enjoyed learning about computational approaches for text analysis and took courses on quantitative methods, finite state machines, sociolinguistics and field methods. I have extensive teaching experience, and more recently I've undergone further training to teach data science and computational techniques through [The Carpentries Instructor training](https://carpentries.org/index.html)

I'm interested in:
- computational approaches to text analysis 
- open access 
- open research practices
- information/misinformation
- translation and the use of corpora in translation (particularly collocation analysis and parallel text analysis)
- foreign languages in general (and the Romance languages in particular)
- the science of learning
- sociolinguistics/language variation
- pragmatics
