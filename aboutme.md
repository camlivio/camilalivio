Hi! My name is Camila Lívio Emídio, but I go by Camila Lívio. 

### My Academic Interests
I first moved to the U.S. for a Fulbright fellowship back in 2013. I've always been interested in foreign languages and linguistics, which led me to a Ph.D. in Romance Languages. During my time as a graduate student I really enjoyed learning about computational approaches for text analysis and took courses on Quantitative Methods, Finite State Machines, and Sociolinguistics and Field Methods. Some topics I'm interested in:
- computational approaches to text analysis
- open access
- open research practices
- information/misinformation
- translation and the use of corpora in translation (particularly collocation analysis and parallel text analysis)
- foreign languages in general (and the Romance languages in particular)
- sociolinguistics
- pragmatics
