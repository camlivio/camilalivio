I'm currently the Scholarly Communications Coordinator at the University of Georgia Libraries, working primarily with Open Access and Research initiatives in the Department of Research and Computational Data Management. I also hold a Ph.D. in Romance Languages (Linguistics) and wrote a dissertation on *text analysis*, *digital language*, *intensification*, and *sociolinguistics*.
