I'm currently the Scholarly Communications Coordinator at the University of Georgia Libraries, working primarily with Open Access and Research initiatives in the Department of Research and Computational Data Management. I also hold a Ph.D. in Romance Languages (Linguistics) and wrote [a dissertation](https://esploro.libs.uga.edu/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Digital-Approaches-to-Intensification-in-Portuguese/9949574421902959?institution=01GALI_UGA) on text analysis, digital language, intensification, and sociolinguistics.
